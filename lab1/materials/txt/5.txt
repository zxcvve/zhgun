Marshfield was a rapid transit station on the Chicago "L" in service between 1895 and 1954. Constructed by the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad, it was the westernmost station of the Metropolitan's main line, which then diverged into three branches. Marshfield was also served by the Aurora Elgin and Chicago Railway (AE&C) and its descendant the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad (CA&E), an interurban, between 1905 and 1953.

The Metropolitan, one of four companies operating the "L", handed its lines over to the Chicago Elevated Railways (CER) trust in 1911. The companies forming the trust formally merged into the Chicago Rapid Transit Company (CRT) in 1924, which continued operation of the "L" until it was taken over by the publicly-held Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) in 1947.
